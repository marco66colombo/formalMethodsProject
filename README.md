# Formal Methods For Concurrent and Real Time Systems Project

Uppaal Model Checker project.

## Abstract
In this project is presented an UPPAAL model for railway networks based on rechargeable
batteries installed on trains as source of energy, with a special focus on the design choices, extensibility,
property verification and limitations.
Special emphasis is placed on the train and how they can flow in the line without losing charge,
how they approach a station and how they are allowed to get in, how they can move from a station
to another without exceeding the specific line they belong to, and how a station can handle the
flow of multiple trains, having a limited number of tracks.
